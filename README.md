**Problem / Challenge Identified**:<br>
**Problem statements:** DeFi is a new space for users. Though investing in crypto assets and earning yield
on them is available to them but a still lot in the DeFi space needs to be explored
by user.Unfortunately due to lack of required technical skills like knowledge of
working with smart contracts, very often users are unable to harness the potential
of DeFi investments such as Flash loans, yield farming, DeFi Staking etc. our
project aims at solving this issue bridging this technical gap and making defi space
more accessible to users and making a one stop platform for all your DeFi
investments.

***How solution addresses the problem***<br>

minimum risk investments and other DeFi investments such as:

single atomic transaction.
3. All this functionality will be available to the user using a simple GUI
4. Tools used:
